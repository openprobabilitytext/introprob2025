# Fundamentals of Probability and its Axioms

## Combinations and Permutations
Counting plays a very important role in probability. In probability, we often deal with sets, and counting methods such as combinations and permutations help us find the number of elements in a set. Specifically, in probability, we deal with a set called the **sample space** which is the set of all possible outcomes of some random experiment and **events**, which are subsets of the sample space. Typically, the sample space is denoted by $S$ or $\Omega.$ Consider the following example:

**Example 1.1.**
Suppose a fair coin is flipped twice.What is the probability of flipping at least one head?

**Solution:**
The sample space of this experiment can expressed as             $S=\{HH,HT,TH,TT\}$. Now, consider the event:
$$A=\{\text{At least one outcome is a head}\}$$
Notice that $A\subset S$ ($A$ is a subset of $S$). Since $A=\{HH,HT,TH\},$ we can find the probability as follows:
$$P(A)= \frac{\#\text{elements in A}}{\#\text{elements in S}}=\frac{3}{4}.$$

The above method of computing the probability of an event, while very useful, is not always suitable for the following reasons:

  1. Each outcome has to be equally likely.
  2. The sets must be countable. 
  
From the previous example, it is clear that counting the number of elements of sets is very important when dealing with discrete sets. We will do this more efficiently by utilizing tools from combinations and permutations.

### Permutations

We will begin by stating the following crucial theorem.

**Theorem 1.1: The Fundamental Principle of Counting**

Consider $k$ experiments. Let $n_i$ denote the number of possible outcomes of the $i$th experiment where $i=1,2,\dots,k.$ Then the total of number of possible outcomes is
$$n_1\times n_2\times\cdots\times n_k.$$
**Example 1.2.** 
A 6-sided die is rolled twice. How many possible outcomes are there? 

**Solution:**
First roll has 6 outcomes and the second roll has 6 outcomes. Therefore, there are $6\times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes when a dice rolled twice. 

In general, if a 6-die is rolled $n$ times, then there are $6^n$ possible outcomes. 

**Example 1.3.** 
Suppose a password must contain exactly 4 symbols, where each symbol is either a letter (a-z) or a number (0-9). How many passwords can be created,

1. if the password is not case-sensitive?
2. if the first two symbols must be numbers? 
3. if the first two symbols must be numbers and the rest should be letters?

**Solution:**

1. If the password is not case-sensitive, then there are $36\times36\times36\times36$ different passwords. 
2. If the first two symbols must be numbers, then there are $10\times10\times36\times36$ different passwords.
3. If the first two symbols must be numbers and the rest should be letters, then there are $10\times10\times26\times26$ different passwords.
 
 **Exercise 1.1.** 
Repeat the above example assuming the password is case-sensitive. 

**Example 1.4:**
Suppose a password must contain exactly 4 symbols, where each symbol is either a letter (a-z) or a number (0-9). How many passwords contain at least one letter? 

**Solution:** 
Total number of passwords = $36^4$. 
Total number of passwords not containing a letter = $10^4$. 
Therefore, the number of passwords containing at least one letter is $$36^4-10^4.$$

Imagine three objects labeled $A,B,$ and $C.$ The number of ways we can arrange these objects is called a *permutation.* These objects can be arranged in six different ways:
$$ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.$$
The formula to find the number of permutations of $n$ *distinct* objects is $$n!=n\times (n-1)\times\cdots\times 2\times 1.$$
For three distinct objects, the number of permutations is $3!=6.$

**Example 1.5.**
In a class, there are 4 sophomores, 7 juniors, and 3 seniors. 

  1. How many ways are these students be arranged in a row? 
  2. How many ways can these students be arranged if all the seniors should remain together? 
  
**Solution:** 

1. $12!$
2. Since the seniors must stand together, we think of the seniors as one ``block". Therefore, together with this block, 4 sophomores, and 7 juniors, there are 12 objects to be arranged. We can also arrange the three seniors within the block in $3!$ ways. Therefore, the total number of permutations is:

```{r ExPemut, echo = FALSE, out.width='80%', out.height='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("class_example_permutations.png")
```

**Exercise 1.2.**
    How many ways can the students be arranged if students from the same year should remain together? 

**Exercise 1.3.**
    How many ways can the students be arranged if two particular students do not wish to stand together? 
    
**Exercise 1.4.**
    How many ways can the students be arranged if at most two seniors should be together? 

Now let's learn how to find the permutations of objects that are non-distinct (some are identical). Consider the permutations of AAB. Since we have two identical objects, the number of permutations has to be less than $3!$ (since permuting the two ``A"s gives us the same arrangement). 

**Theorem 1.1: Permutations of non-identical objects**
Consider a set of $n$ objects of which $n_1$ objects are alike, $n_2$ objects are alike, $\dots$, $n_k$ objects are alike. Then, the number of permutations of these $n$ objects is given by
    $$\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\cdots n_k!}$$

**Example 1.6.**
Find the number of ways the following words can be permuted:

1. MATH
2. BEEP
3. COCO
4. SUCCESS

**Solution:** 

1. 4 different letters. Therefore, number of permutations: $$4!.$$
2. 4 letters word, 2 letters are alike. Therefore, number of permutations:  $$\frac{4!}{2!}.$$
3. 4 letters word, 2 letters are alike and another 2 letters are alike. Therefore, number of permutations:  $$\frac{4!}{2!2!}.$$
4. 7 letters word, 3 letters are alike and another 2 letters are alike. Therefore, number of permutations:  $$\frac{7!}{3!2!}.$$
 
In each of the above questions, we make an adjustment for over-counting by diving by the permutations of identical objects.

### Combinations
Combinations are the number of ways a subset can be chosen from a larger set where the order of the selection does not matter. Consider a set of $n$ distinct objects. The number of ways a subset of $r\leq n$ objects can be chosen can be computed using the formula $${n\choose r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}.$$
The key point here is that, unlike in permutations, the order of the $r$ objects selected is irrelevant. 

**Example 1.7.**
 Suppose a shelf contains 10 distinct books out of which 4 are math books and the rest are physics books. 
 
1. How many ways can 3 books be chosen where the order does not matter? 
   
2. How many ways can 4 books be chosen so that exactly two are math books? 

**Solution:**
1. $$10\choose 3$$

2. The number of ways two math books can be chosen = $4\choose 2$\\
  The number of ways two other books (non-math) can be chosen = $6\choose 2$\\

Therefore, the total number of ways exactly two math books can be chosen is
        $${4\choose 2}{6\choose 2}.$$

**Exercise 1.5.**
How many ways can at least one math book be chosen?

**Exercise 1.6.**
How many ways can at most one math book be chosen?


Some questions in this course involves questions based on a deck of cards. This is the composition of a deck of cards:

```{r ExCardDeck, echo = FALSE, out.width='80%', out.height='50%',fig.cap="Illustration of a standard deck of cards."}
