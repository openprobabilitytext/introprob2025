In probability, we often deal with sets, and counting methods such as combinations and permutations help us find the number of elements in a set. Specifically, in probability, we deal with a set called the sample space which is the set of all possible outcomes of some random experiment and events, which are subsets of the sample space. Typically, the sample space is denoted by \\(S\\) or \\(\\Omega.\\) Consider the following example: Example 1.1. Suppose a fair coin is flipped twice.What is the probability of flipping at least one head? Solution: The sample space of this experiment can expressed as \\(S=\\{HH,HT,TH,TT\\}\\). Now, consider the event: \\[A=\\{\\text{At least one outcome is a head}\\}\\] Notice that \\(A\\subset S\\) (\\(A\\) is a subset of \\(S\\)). Since \\(A=\\{HH,HT,TH\\},\\) we can find the probability as follows: \\[P(A)= \\frac{\\#\\text{elements in A}}{\\#\\text{elements in S}}=\\frac{3}{4}.\\] The above method of computing the probability of an event, while very useful, is not always suitable for the following reasons: Each outcome has to be equally likely. The sets must be countable. From the previous example, it is clear that counting the number of elements of sets is very important when dealing with discrete sets. We will do this more efficiently by utilizing tools from combinations and permutations. 1.1.1 Permutations We will begin by stating the following crucial theorem. Theorem 1.1: The Fundamental Principle of Counting Consider \\(k\\) experiments. Let \\(n_i\\) denote the number of possible outcomes of the \\(i\\)th experiment where \\(i=1,2,\\dots,k.\\) Then the total of number of possible outcomes is \\[n_1\\times n_2\\times\\cdots\\times n_k.\\] Example 1.2. A 6-sided die is rolled twice. How many possible outcomes are there? Solution: First roll has 6 outcomes and the second roll has 6 outcomes. Therefore, there are \\(6\\times 6 = 36\\) possible outcomes when a dice rolled twice. In general, if a 6-die is rolled \\(n\\) times, then there are \\(6^n\\) possible outcomes. Example 1.3. Suppose a password must contain exactly 4 symbols, where each symbol is either a letter (a-z) or a number (0-9). How many passwords can be created, if the password is not case-sensitive. if the first two symbols must be numbers. if the first two symbols must be numbers and the rest should be letters. Solution: If the password is not case-sensitive, then there are \\(36\\times36\\times36\\times36\\) different passwords. If the first two symbols must be numbers, then there are \\(10\\times10\\times36\\times36\\) different passwords. If the first two symbols must be numbers and the rest should be letters, then there are \\(10\\times10\\times26\\times26\\) different passwords. Exercise 1.1. Repeat the above example assuming the password is case-sensitive. Example 1.4: Suppose a password must contain exactly 4 symbols, where each symbol is either a letter (a-z) or a number (0-9). How many passwords contain at least one letter? Solution Total number of passwords = \\(36^4\\). Total number of passwords not containing a letter = \\(10^4\\). herefore, the number of passwords containing at least one letter is \\[36^4-10^4.\\] "],["basic-probability.html", "Chapter 2 Basic Probability", " Chapter 2 Basic Probability "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
